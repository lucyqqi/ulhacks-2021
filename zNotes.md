Problem: students are frustrated w/ the lack of resources during their high-school journey. there's often a lot of resources for STEM, however very little for creative writing, given it is more of a niche. english literacy issue. They also lack the motivation to work on assignments.

solution: We want to learn to provide them with contest resources and opportunities to help enhance their skills, and provide them with the support they need. our website offers useful tips to display their creativity and voice through writing (e.g., poetry, prose). Our special text editor will display fancy yet satisfying effects/sounds while the user is typing to enourage them to work harder.

how it works: gonna be summarizer (lucy will explain how it works once she uses her brain), editor features, then text, and we can add some cool javascript features in there and be like wow we're so cool


Here we make a list of things we want to do:

Functions:
  Level up<- medium difficulty
  Text summarizer<- simple but could go south fast
    so much misinformation these days, it's hard to find factuable and valuable information, that's why our text summarizer is like here to save time

Aesthetics:
  Fade in text? <-very hard but cool
  Sound effects <- prob easy
  
Educational
  Text summarizer, text editor --> writing relating initatives
