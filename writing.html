<h1>WRITING TIPS</h1>


  <h2> Tip 1: Don’t stress about the first draft. </h2>

<p id = "tips" > You may feel pressured to edit as you go, but resist the urge. You’ll have time to edit the first draft later. Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect. </p>

<h2> Tip 2: Have someone else look over your work for you. </h2>

<p id = "tips"> After you’re finished editing your piece, send it to a friend. Having another pair of eyes can help you catch grammatical and structural errors you may have missed. You may also want to ask them questions about your piece, such as “What was your favourite part?” or “What section do you think needs improvement?” This will help you understand what your readers are looking for.</p>

<h2>Tip 3: Think about your own experience.</h2>

<p id = "tips">Sometimes, if you run out of creative ideas, maybe write a story based on your own experience. This will ensure that the idea is original and realistic! It is also much easier to reiterate an experience that you personally went through than to think of something completely new. This may be due to the fact that you have already told the story multiple times to other people, so when you put it on paper, it will run smoothly and the content will be interesting to the readers. However, try to pick an interesting memory that you have and not just your daily routine!</p>
